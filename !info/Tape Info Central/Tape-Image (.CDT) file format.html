<h1>Tape-Image (.CDT) file format</h1>

<p>The &quot;.CDT&quot; tape image file format is identical to the &quot;.TZX&quot; file
format designed by Tomaz Kac and used by Spectrum emulators. The filename has a different extension to differentiate
between tape-images for use on the Amstrad and tape-images for use on the Spectrum.

<p>The most recent version of this format can be found at <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org">World of Spectrum</a>.
<h2>ZX TAPE FILE FORMAT v1.13</h2>

<I>Last changed by Tomaz Kac, November 2, 1998</I> 
<p>This format lets you preserve all (hopefully) of the 
tapes with turbo or custom loading routines. Even though some of the newer and 
'smarter' emulators can find most of the info about the loader from the code 
itself, this isn't posible if you want to save the file to tape, or to a real 
Spectrum. And with all this information in the file, the emulators don't have to 
bother with finding out the baud rate and other things. <p>This file format 
was originally written for usage on ZX Spectrum compatible computers only, but 
as it turned out the SAM Coupe, Amstrad CPC, Jupiter ACE and Enterprise range of 
computers use the same tape encoding. It can be used for ZX-81 type of computers 
also, even though the encoding is somewhat different (for now there is no 
convertor for ZX-81 tapes into TZX). There are some special blocks which can be 
used on Commodore 64. <p>There is a table at the end of this file which 
displays (not totally official) timings for each machine ROM routines use. Also 
the description of the difference of encoding is written there. If you know of 
any other machines that have similar encoding that could be used with this file 
format then let me know. <p>The latest version of this format can be found 
at 'World of Spectrum'. You can also find many TZX files at the same address. 
The URL of 'WOS' is: <p><A 
href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/">http://www.worldofspectrum.org/</A> 
<p>The format was first started off by Tomaz Kac who was maintainer until 
revision 1.13, now this task is taken over by Martijn v.d. Heide ... if you have 
any questions about the format please e-mail to <A 
href="mailto:mheide@worldofspectrum.org">mheide@worldofspectrum.org</A>. 
<p>The default format file extension is "TZX". Hopefully this won't have to 
change in the future. (For RISC OS, the current <A 
href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/faq/fileform.html#TAPZ">TAP</A> filetype 
will be used.) <p>Amstrad CPC files should use the extension &quot;CDT&quot; to 
distinguish them from the ZX Spectrum files. Otherwise the inner structure is 
totally the same. <p>

<p>The file is identified with the first 8 bytes being 'ZXTape!' 
plus the 'end of file' byte 26 (1A hex). This is followed by two bytes 
containing the major and minor version numbers. (For this format revision: 
major=01 and minor=13) <p>To be able to use a TZX file, your program 
(emulator, utility, or whatever) must be able to handle files of at least its 
major version number. <p>If your program can handle (say) version 1.05 and 
you encounter a file with version number 1.06, your program <I>must</I> be able 
to handle it, even if it cannot handle <I>all</I> the data in the file. The data 
it cannot handle should be relatively unimportant. <p>The main body of the 
file follows; it consists of a mixture of blocks, each identified by an ID byte. 
There are currently 20 types of blocks. <p>The file structure is: 
<PRE>        0       &quot;ZXTape!&quot;
        7       0x1A
        8       Major version number
        9       Minor version number
        A       ID of first block
        B       Body of first block
        ...
</PRE><A name="changes"><h3>CHANGES SINCE v1.13</h3></a>

<p>The Commodore 64/128 is now supported by the format. The encoding is the 
same, but because of different block structure two new block types had to be 
added, which can be used by other machines too if necessary, but their primary 
usage is on C-64. The new blocks are <A 
href="#id16">16</A> and <A 
href="#id17">17</A>. The hardware 
specific information about the encoding is stored in another file because there 
is quite a lot of it, but you can also find out from the blocks. <p>
<A name="changesold"><h3>CHANGES SINCE v1.12</h3></a>

<p>
<UL>
  <LI>Added the following fields to the '<A 
  href="#id32">Archive Info</A>' block: 
  <UL>
    <LI>05 - Game/Utility Type 
    <LI>06 - Price 
    <LI>07 - Protection Scheme / Loader 
    <LI>08 - Origin </LI></UL>

    <LI>'ZX-Edit document' - for .ZED files generated by the great ZX-Editor! 
    <LI>'Picture ' - for .GIF and .JPEG (.JPG) pictures </LI></UL>
  <LI>Added the new ID for the Enterprise computer with encoding and timings 
  information (these might not be 100% correct though, Paul Hodgson is working 
  on emulating this computer and will also supply new values when done). 
</LI></UL><p>
<A name="rules"><h3>THE RULES</h3></a>

<p>Relevant rules and definitions important for the emulator and utility 
authors who will support the format: 
<UL>
  <LI>Any value requiring more than one byte is stored in little endian format 
  (ie. LSB first). 
  <LI>All unused bits should be set to zero. 
  <LI>The timings are given in Z80 clock ticks (T states) unless otherwise 
  stated.<p>1 T state = (1/3500000)s 
  <LI>The values in the tables are as follows: <PRE>offset (in hex)         length (1 = byte, 2 = short word, etc.)</PRE> 
  The block IDs are also given in hex. 
  <LI>All ASCII texts must include only characters from 32 to 127 (decimal), 
  some of them can have several lines, which should be separated by ASCII 13 
  (dec). 
  <LI>You might interpret full-period as ----____ or ____----, and half-period 
  as ---- or ____. One half-period will also be referred to as a <I>pulse</I>. 
  <LI>The values in square brackets [] are the default values for things such as 
  the Spectrum ROM load/save routines - they should be used for all standard 
  loading blocks. These values are in decimal. 
  <LI>If there is <I>no</I> pause between two data blocks then the second one 
  should follow <I>immediately</I>; not even so much as one T state between 
  them. 
  <LI>This document refers to 'high' and 'low' pulse levels. Whether this is 
  implemented as ear=1 and ear=0 respectively or the other way around is not 
  important, as long as it is done consistently. 
  <LI>Zeros and ones in Direct Recording blocks signify low and high pulse 
  levels respectively. The 'current pulse level' after playing a Direct 
  Recording block is the last level played. 
  <LI>Standard Speed Data blocks, Turbo Loading blocks, Pure Tone blocks and 
  Sequence Of Pulses With Different Timings blocks consists of a (possibly odd) 
  number of pulses. (The 'current pulse level' after playing these blocks is 
  therefore the opposite of the last pulse level played, so that a subsequent 
  pulse will produce an edge.) 
  <LI>A 'Pause' block consists of a 'low' pulse level of some duration. To 
  ensure that the last edge produced is properly finished there should be 
  atleast 1ms pause of the <I>opposite</I> level and only after that the pulse 
  should go to 'low'. At the end of a 'Pause' block the 'current pulse level' is 
  low. (Note that the first pulse will therefore not immediately produce an 
  edge.) A 'pause' block of zero duration is completely ignored, so the 'current 
  pulse level' will NOT change in this case. This also applies to 'Data' blocks 
  that have some pause duration included in them. 
  <LI>An emulator should put the 'current pulse level' to 'low' when starting to 
  play a TZX file, either from the start or from a certain position. The writer 
  of a TZX file should ensure that the 'current pulse level' is well-defined in 
  every sequence of blocks where this is important, i.e. in any sequence that 
  includes a Direct Recording block, or that depends on edges generated by Pause 
  blocks. The recommended way of doing this is to include a Pause after each 
  sequence of blocks. 
  <LI>When creating a Direct Recording block please stick to the standard 
  sampling frequencies of 22050 or 44100 Hz. This will ensure correct playback 
  when using PC's soundcards. 
  <LI>The length of a block is given in the following format: Numbers in square 
  brackets [] mean that the value must be read from the offset in the brackets. 
  Other values are normal numbers. Example: [02,03]+0A means: get number (a 
  word) from offset 02 and add 0A. All numbers are in hex ! 
  <LI>ALL Custom blocks that will be added after version 1.00 will have the 
  length of the block in first 4 bytes (long word) after the ID (this length 
  does <I>not</I> include these 4 length bytes). This should enable programs 
  that can only handle older versions to skip that block. </LI></UL>Just in case: 
<PRE>  MSB = most significant byte
  LSB = least significant byte
  MSb = most significant bit
  LSb = least significant bit

Block</B></a><p>Well, this block was created to support the Commodore 64 standard 
ROM and similar tape blocks. It is made so basically anything that uses two or 
four pulses (which are the same in pairs) per bit can be written with it. Some 
explanation: 
<UL>
  <LI>A wave consists of TWO pulses. In the structure the length of one pulse is 
  written ! 
  <LI>The wave MUST always start with the LOW amplitude ... since the C64 can 
  only detect the transistion HIGH -&gt; LOW ! 
  <LI>If some pulse length is 0 then the whole wave must not be present. This 
  applies to DATA too ! 
  <LI>The XOR checksum (if it is set to 0 or 1) is a XOR of all bits in the byte 
  XOR-ed with the value in this field as the start value. 
  <LI>Finish Byte waves should be played after each byte EXCEPT last one. 
  <LI>Finish Data waves should be ONLY played after last byte of data. 
  <LI>When all the Data has finished there is an optional Trailer Tone, which is 
  standard for the Repeated Blocks in C64 ROM Loader. </LI></UL>The replay 
procedure looks like this:<p>
<OL>
  <LI>Pilot Tone 
  <LI>Sync waves 
  <LI>Data Bytes (with XOR and/or Finish Byte waves) 
  <LI>Finish Data pulses

<p>Currently supported machines are: ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, SAM Coupe, ZX-81 
Jupiter ACE and Enterprise. Only ZX-81 (or the old Timex 1000) and Jupiter ACE 
use different tape encoding than the others.<p>The Commodore 64 encoding is 
described in a separate file <A

<U>ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, SAM Coupe, Jupiter ACE &amp; Enterprise 
Tape Encoding</U></B><p>These computers share the same tape encoding, 
which is normal Frequency type encoding. Each bit is represented by one 'wave' 
of different duration for bit 0 and bit 1. Normally bit 1 is twice as big as bit 
0. In the blocks, the timings are presented with Z80 T-states (cycles) per 
pulse. One wave is made from two pulses.<p><U>IMPORTANT</U><p>Z80 Clock 
rate is always timed at 3.5 MHz, so if the tape should be used on an Amstrad CPC 
with 4MHz clock then you should multiply ALL timings with 4/3.5 when you use 
that tape (this should be trivial), similary goes for SAM Coupe, that uses a 
6MHz clock and Jupiter ACE that uses 3.2448 MHz and Enterprise that uses 4 MHz! 
<p>The Standard data blocks have always the same structure: First there is 
the Pilot Tone, then the two SYNC pulses (one wave) and after that the actual 
data (which can include a FLAG byte at the beginning and a Check-Sum byte at the 
end). <p>Here is a table showing the pulse timings for each part of the 
standard ROM load/save routine for wach of these machines. If you have more 
accurate information then I would be glad to include it here. Enterprise has two 
loading speeds so timings for both are included. (more accurate timings and more 
info on Pilot length for the Enterprise will be provided in the next release of 
this format). <PRE>    Machine      Pilot pulse, length  Sync1    Sync2    Bit-0    Bit-1

Lengths for Header and Data blocks. Header blocks have 8064 and data blocks have 
3220 pilot pulses.<p>(2) Amstrad CPC ROM Load/Save routine can use variable 
speed for loading, so the Bit-1 pulse must be read from the Pilot Tone and Bit-0 
can be read from the Sync pulses, and is always half the size of Bit-1. The 
Check-Sum is also different than the other two machines. The speed can vary from 
1000 to 2000 baud.<p>(3) Jupiter ACE also uses different Pilot Lengths for 
Header and Data blocks. Header blocks have 8192 and Data blocks have 1024 pilot 
pulses. The last byte of the data is a XOR of all previous bytes (as in 
Spectrum). Also, at the end of everything there is a pulse of 762 T-states. The 
Header block has Sync byte (first byte after Sync pulses) 0 and the Data blocks 
can have anything but 0.<p>(*) The SAM Coupe timings can be user selected by a 
System Variable... the standard value being at 112, which is VERY close to ZX 
Spectrum loading speed, and therefore the 'Standard Speed Data' block can be 
used for those blocks. However if this System Variable is changed then the 
timings will change accordingly... in the above table the value of this variable 
is given as 'W', the 'H' value is 'W/2'. Of course the best way to determine it 
is to calculate it from the timings you get when sampling the Pilot tone... The 
values in the table could be by a fraction off the real ones, but it should not 
matter. Note: All timings are written in 3.5MHz clock. Also, there might be some 
junk bits (usually 7 or 8) AFTER the CheckSum (XOR) byte at the end of the 
block... they can just be ignored...<p>(**) The Enterprise stores data in a 
different way than all other computers do. It stores the Least Significant Bit 
first, but the Data blocks require the data to be Most Significant Bit first. 
This might lead to some confusion, but if the same mechanism is used to replay 
data for all machines then there will be no problem. Just store the data as Most 
Significant Bit first, but if you want to view the raw data in the TZX file then 
you will have to mirror each byte to get the correct values. <p>NOTE: The 
ZXTape format has ALL timings written according to a 3.5MHz clock... when you 
want to use it on a, for example, 4MHz clock based computer you should multiply 
ALL timings with 1.142857 (Do NOT use 4MHz or 6MHz base clock to store the 
timings in a TZX file!) <p><p><B><U>ZX-81 (and compatibles) 
Tape Encoding</U></B><p>ZX-81 uses tape encoding which makes loading A 
LOT slowe than the other machines. Unfortunately this type of encoding can 
<I>not</I> be described with the 'Custom Loading Data' block, but with a series 
of 'Pure Tone' and 'Pause' blocks. Since no custom loaders were used on it, All 
ZX-81 tapes used this encoding and therefore the 'Standard Speed Data' block can 
be used for it. <p>Main difference is that the encoding is not 
frequency-based, it is rather based on the number of waves. Bit-0 is represented 
by 3 to 5 (normally 4) waves and Bit-1 is represented by 6 to 9 waves (normally 
8). The frequency of the waves is 12kHz (each pulse is ~637 T-states long). 
After each series of waves there is a small pause (approximately the same 
duration as Bit-0). <p>So the 01 sequence would look like this (~~__ is one 
wave, --- is pause): 
<p>---~~__~~__~~__~~__---------~~__~~__~~__~~__~~__~~__~~__~~__---------~~__~~... 
<p>The Pilot Tone seems to be structured as the following sequence: 
10101010 (the same timing as the data), after which the Data follows imemdiately 
(<I>no</I> Sync pulses are present between them). <p><p>If the tape should 
be used for any <I>other</I> computer than ZX-Spectrum then it should have the 
'Hardware Info' block as the first block in which the computer type should be 
described.<p>Because the Standard Loading data blocks of ZX-Spectrum. SAM 
Coupe and ZX-81 are so unique (i.e. they are always the same) the 'Standard 
Loading Data' block can be used for their description. Amstrad CPC tapes should 
always use the 'Custom Loading Data' block, since the speed is not always the 
same. <p><p><A name="hardware"><h3>HARDWARE INFORMATION</h3></a>

<p>This is the list of all Hardware Types and Hardware Identification ID's that 
are used in the 'Hardware Info' block. Please send any additions you might have 
to me so they can be included. <p>By Default you don't have to write any of 
the information if the game is made for the ZX Spectrum and complies with the 
following:<p>- Runs on ZX Spectrum 48K<p>- Runs on, but doesn't use any of the 
special hardware of ZX Spectrum 128K<p>- Doesn't run on ZX Spectrum 
16K<p>If, for example, game works on BOTH ZX 48K and 128K, and uses the 
hardware of the 128K Spectrum, then you would just include the 128K Spectrum in 
the list (because by default it has to work on 48K too)...<p>If the game is 
128K ONLY then you would include two entries: The game works on AND uses the 
hardware of a 128K Spectrum AND the game DOESN'T work on a 48K Spectrum.<p>If 
the game works on both 48K and 128K Spectrum, but it only uses the Sound chip 
(AY) of the 128K Spectrum and none of its extra memory then you would only 
include the entry that says that the game uses the 'Classic AY Hardware 
(Spectrum 128 Compatible Sound Device)'. <p>These were only some examples 
of the usage of this block. <PRE>Hardware Type              Hardware ID
