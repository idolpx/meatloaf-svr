Encoding:
---------

Uses the same encoding as Standard Turbo Tape.

 Bit 0:  483 T-States
 Bit 1: 1008 T-States

Data Endianess: MOST Significant bit First

 Lead-In Byte:  $80
    Sync Byte:  $FF

Still to find out: 100% Correct Timings (Now gathered from TAP files) !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Structure:
----------

  The length of the block is calculated from Start and End address, which is
written at the start of the block (after the SYNC Byte). After tese 4 bytes
the Filename is stored in 16 bytes (but only first 10 seem to be used).

 00 Start Address of data (Low, High byte)
 02 End   Address of data (Low, High byte)
 04 Filename (16 bytes)
 14 Data
 .. XOR Checksum of all Data

  After the Filename the actual data is found. After the Data the XOR checksum
byte is written, which is the XOR of all Data (the start and end address and
the Filename are NOT included in the XOR calculation).

Still to find out: - Nothing :)
