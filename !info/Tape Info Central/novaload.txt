Encoding:
---------

 Bit 0:  511 T-States
 Bit 1: 1222 T-States

  Data Endianess: LEAST Significant bit First

  Pilot Tone is constructed of MANY $00 Bytes (normally 255-257). Pilot end's
when Bit 1 is read. After this bit the actual Data starts.

Still to find out: 100% Correct Timings (Now gathered from TAP files) !

Structure:
----------

  First byte of a block is always $AA which is considered as FLAG byte.
  
  The Second byte read can either be $55 in which case this block is considered
as 'Special' block, if it is anything else than $55 than this is the following
data that is present (including this byte):

  1 byte  Length of filename    (this can be $00 - then no filename follows !)
  n bytes Filename
  2 bytes Load Address        - $100 (you have to add $100 to get actual add.)
  2 bytes End  Address
  2 bytes Length of the block + $100 (here you must substract $100 to get len.)
  
After this a series of sub-blocks start with the length of DATA being 256 if
there is some more data avialble otherwise the length is whatever is left...
  
  1 byte  Checksum so far
  n bytes Data (either 256 or less bytes)

This is then repeated until whole data is read in from the 256 long blocks.

After all sub-blocks there is FINAL Checksum ...

The checksum starts with the first byte read (Length of filename) and is
normal addition of all bytes (you have to do checksum = (checksum + byte) & 0xFF
to get correct result). After you check the checksum you must also add it !

If the Length of filename (the byte after the FLAG) is $55 then the block
structure is different:

    1 byte  Load Address HIGH Byte only
  256 bytes Data
    1 byte  Checksum

This is first repeated UNTIL Load address is $F0 , after which is again repeated
UNTIL Load address is $00 ! 

The Checksum is calculated the same way as before (starts with the 1st byte AFTER $55).

All blocks also have some TRAILING Tone present after the end of the block.

Still to find out: - Nothing
