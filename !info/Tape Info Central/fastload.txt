------------------
Info by Luigi Di Fraia <armaeth@libero.it>

Used in: "Cybernoid" (from Zer0-X), "Deflektor", "Mask 2" and "North Star" 
(supplied by c64heaven)

Structure:
  There are 2 complete CBM files. Fist CBM part is loaded at $02A7, autoexecutes 
  and loads a 2nd complete CBM file (which contains the Turbo Loader) at $0400 
  (video area) and executes it.
  Second CBM file has different names:
    "FASTLOAD" in "Deflektor" and "Mask 2" (Header CRC32: $26768E85) 
    "HELLO" in "Cybernoid" and "North Star" (Header CRC32: $B3A82F14)
Turbo blocks:
  Bit 0: $32
  Bit 1: $63
  Endianess: MSbF

  Lead-in: Bit 1 pulses (x215 about)
  Sync: a single Bit 0 pulse

  Header:
  ------

  2 bytes: File ID ("01", "02", "03", etc.)
  2 bytes: Load address (Low/High)
  2 bytes: Data Size (Low/High)

  Data (last pulse is usually broken = not matching given pulse lengths)

  Trailer: none found.

Notes:
  some pulses were found before the first turbo block leader. They were used as 
  separator: 7-8 Bit 1 pulses and 169 Bit 0 pulses. They must be kept.
