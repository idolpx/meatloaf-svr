Encoding:
---------

Uses the same encoding as Standard Turbo Tape.

 Bit 0: 511 T-States
 Bit 1: 923 T-States

Data Endianess: MOST Significant bit First

 Lead-In Byte:  $40
    Sync Byte:  $5A

Still to find out: 100% Correct Timings (Now gathered from TAP files) !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Structure:
----------

  The length of the block is calculated from Start and End address, which is
written at the start of the block (after the SYNC Byte):

 00 Start Address of data (Low, High byte)
 02 End   Address of data (Low, High byte)
 04 Data
 .. XOR Checksum of Data

  After the start and end address the actual data is found. After the Data the
XOR checksum byte is written, which is the XOR of all Data (the start and end
address are NOT included in the XOR calculation).

Still to find out: - Nothing :)
