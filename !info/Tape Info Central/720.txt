===============
  info by Ben Castricum <webmaster@cia.c64.org>

Encoding:
---------

Uses the same encoding as Standard Turbo Tape.

 Bit 0: 525 T-States
 Bit 1: 895 T-States

Data Endianess: MOST Significant bit First

 Lead-In Byte:  $20
    Sync Byte:  $FF

Still to find out: 100% Correct Timings (Now gathered from TAP files) !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Structure:
----------

  Right after the Sync Byte there are 16 bytes which form the FileName. The
length of the block is calculated from Start and End address, which is written
after the Filename:

 00 Filename (16 bytes)
 10 Start Address of data (Low, High byte)
 12 End   Address of data (Low, High byte)
 14 Data

  After the start and end address the actual data is found. There is no XOR
checksum in this loader...

Still to find out: - Nothing :)
