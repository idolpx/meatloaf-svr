Encoding:
---------

Uses the same encoding as Standard Turbo Tape.

 Bit 0:  511 T-States
 Bit 1: 1222 T-States

Data Endianess: LEAST Significant bit First

 Pilot tone is Bit-0 Repeated atleast 3000 Times and it ends with single Bit 1 !
 
Still to find out: 100% Correct Timings (Now gathered from TAP files) !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Structure:
----------

  There are 3 different Ocean/Imagine loaders found so far. The difference are
very small, so almost the same decoding can be used.

  The Types 2 & 3 have additional FLAG byte after the Sync Bit.. this FLAG is
 0xAA.

  Data is structured from blocks, each block is 256 bytes long. The following
information is sent before each block of all three types:

  00 if it is $01 then write $00 to address $0001 (Page in RAM !)
  01 HIGH Byte of Load Address
  
After the HIGH Byte of Load Address the 256 bytes of Data follow.

  The END of loading is signalled by this byte being $00 for Types 1 & 2 ,
Type 3 has the END of the loading signalled by byte $02 !

  Types 1 & 2 also have some TRAILING Tone present, which should be read in !

Still to find out: - Nothing :)
