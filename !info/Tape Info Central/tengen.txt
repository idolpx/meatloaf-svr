TENGEN/DOMARK and IMAGE WORKS tape
----------------------------------
Info by Luigi Di Fraia <armaeth@libero.it>

Used in: "3D construction kit", "Cisco Heat" (IW) [Multiloaded], "Skull and 
Crossbones" [Multiloaded], "Pit Fighter" [Multiloaded], "Badlands", "Rampart" 
[Multiloaded], "Rugby the World Cup" [Multiloaded], "The Spy who loved me" 
[Multiloaded], (thanks to c64heaven for those last 4 taps and "3DCK") and 
probably a lot of other TENGEN/DOMARK Releases.

Structure:
  There are 2 complete CBM files. Fist CBM part (DATA size: 2 -two- bytes, Loads 
  at $029F: 51 03, CRC32: $848FD0AF) autoexecutes, loads 2nd complete CBM file 
  (which contains the Turbo Loader) and executes it.
  Autostarting ROM cartridges are disabled.

Turbo blocks:
  Bit 0: $44
  Bit 1: $65
  Endianess: LSbF

  Pilot byte: $A0 (x255, but a pulse is often missing)
  Sync sequence: $0A, $09, ..., $01

  Header:
  -------
  Type 1 (used to load first blocks only)

    2 bytes: Length of Data (Low/High)
    1 byte: file ID

  Type 2 (used for multi-load parts, if any is present)

    2 bytes: Length of Data (Low/High)
    2 bytes: Load address (Low/High)
    n bytes: file name (size is customable) 

      n=1 in "Skull and Crossbones"
      n=2 in "Cisco Heat", "Hydra" and "Pit Fighter"
      n=4 in "Rampart"

  Data:
  -----
  -Length of Data- bytes: encrypted data.
    To uncrypt do:
      data = data ^ a;
      a = (a + 1) & 0xff;
    setting a=0 BEFORE reading the first encrypted data byte.

  1 byte: XOR Checksum of uncrypted Data

  Trailer: usually few Bit0/Bit1 pulses followed by a bigger pulse (eg. $76-$82)


Notes:
  Header type could be identified by calculating the XOR checksum.
  "Load address" is sometimes ignored ("Cisco Heat", "Pit Fighter", "Rampart").
