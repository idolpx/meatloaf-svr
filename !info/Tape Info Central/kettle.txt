Kettle Loader
=================
  info by Markus Brenner <markus@brenner.de>

Encoding:
---------

 Bit 0:  384 T-States ($1b)
 Bit 1:  526 T-States ($25)


Data Endianess: MOST Significant bit First

 Lead-In Byte:  $63
    Sync Bytes: $64, $65, $66, ... , $ff

   Start Byte:  if $00 restart loading

Structure:
----------

  Synching consists of finding the Lead-In Byte, then reading further
lead-in bytes until the Sync Byte Sequence is found. A start byte is
read, and usually ignored.

  The length of the block is calculated from Start and End address, which is
written at the start of the block (after the SYNC Sequence):

 00 Start Address of data (Low, High byte)
 02 End   Address of data (Low, High byte)
 04-09    stored in Zero Page
 0a DATA
 .. XOR Checksum of all Data

Still to find out: - Nothing
