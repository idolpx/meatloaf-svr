Players Loader
=====================

Encoding:
---------

Uses the same encoding as Standard Turbo Tape.

 Bit 0:  682 T-States
 Bit 1: 1008 T-States

Data Endianess: LEAST Significant bit First

 Lead-In Byte:  $A0
    Sync Byte:  $0A

Still to find out: 100% Correct Timings (Now gathered from TAP file)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Structure:
----------

NOTE: There are 3 ROM chunks in front of the custom blocks. There MUST be Pilot
      Tone AFTER each of the DATA ROM Blocks (not the Headers) ... otherwise you
      will get flashing square when the game starts. 

  This loader uses the Lead-In and SYNC sequence ONLY for the first custom
block. All blocks that follow it are without the Lead-In tone and Sync sequence
and MUST follow the previous block immediately with the Information.

  Sync Sequence of the first block (after the Sync Byte which is $0A) looks
like this :

$09 $08 $07 $06 $05 $04 $03 $02 $01

  Then the following information is given :

 00 End Address of data - 1 (Low, High byte)
 02 Length of data          (Low, High byte)
 04 If this byte is $FE or $FF, this is the last block
 05 DATA
 .. CheckSum byte

  The DATA is loaded in from End to Start (in the opposite direction) !

  DATA is encrypted in the following way:

Real_Value = Value ^ (Address & 0xFF);

(Address being the address to which the byte will be loaded)

  The Checksum is then computed from the Real_Values and is XOR of all Data !

  The End Address AND Length of the Data of the LAST block will be $0000 !
If you want the game to start then you will have to convert the two bytes after
the end address and length to let the game start. (note that the LAST byte that will
be read will NOT have 8 bits, but 7 ... dunno why though).

(length of block = end (2) + len (2) + Flag (1) + checksum (1) = 6)

Still to find out: - Nothing
